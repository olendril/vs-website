# Death Corpses

A [Vintage Story](https://www.vintagestory.at/) mod

Death Corpses spawns a lootable corpse entity at the location where a player dies, preserving their inventory for later retrieval. A map waypoint marks the death site so players can find their way back. Server operators can configure corpse behavior, waypoint appearance, and collection rules to fit their server's play style.

# Credits

Forked from the adapted [PlayerGrave](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/39449) mod, which itself was based on the original mod [Player Corpse](https://mods.vintagestory.at/playercorpse).

---

## Requirements

- Vintage Story `>= 1.21.6` (.NET 8) or `>= 1.22` (.NET 10)

A single zip works on both versions — the mod auto-detects the runtime at startup.

## Usage

### Features

- **Corpse** — On death, a lootable corpse entity spawns containing your inventory. Right-click and hold to collect your items.
- **Death Waypoint** — A map waypoint marks the corpse location, automatically removed on collection.
- **Free Corpse** — After a configurable duration, anyone can loot an unclaimed corpse.
- **Corpse Compass** — Craftable item that highlights nearby corpses with a HUD indicator.
- **Obituary** — Purchasable from traders. Bind to a random player's corpse, then hold to see particle trails pointing toward its general area. Fades into a collectible **Faded Obituary** once the corpse is collected.
- **Random Corpse** — Optional mode that spawns corpses at a random location within a configurable radius of the death point, with no waypoint.
- **Death Recap** — On respawn, receive a chat message summarizing what killed you. Admins control how much detail to reveal: just the cause, cause + coordinates, or cause + coordinates + distance to corpse.

### Commands

All commands require the privilege configured in `CommandPrivilege` (default: `gamemode`).

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/dc corpse list <player>` | Lists all saved corpses for a player, numbered by date |
| `/dc corpse get <player> <give to player> [id]` | Restores a corpse's inventory to a player. `id` is the index from `list` (default: `0`, most recent) |
| `/dc corpse remove <player> [id]` | Removes corpses for a player. If `id` is given, only that saved corpse is removed. Without `id`, deletes all saved corpses and despawns any corpse entities in the world |
| `/dc corpse tp <player> [id]` | Teleports you to a player's corpse. `id` is the index from `list` (default: `0`, most recent) |
| `/dc corpse tpother <target player> <corpse owner> [id]` | Teleports another player to a corpse. `id` is the index from `list` (default: `0`, most recent) |
| `/dc corpse fetch <player> [id]` | Moves a player's corpse entity to your current position. `id` is the index from `list` (default: `0`, most recent) |
| `/dc corpse fetchto <player> <x> <y> <z> [id]` | Moves a player's corpse entity to the specified coordinates. `id` is the index from `list` (default: `0`, most recent) |
| `/dc recap clear` | Removes all pending death recaps from memory and disk |
| `/dc config list` | Shows all config options and their current values |
| `/dc config get <option>` | Shows the current value of a specific config option |
| `/dc config set <option> <value>` | Changes a config option at runtime and saves it to disk |

### Configuration

The config file is created at `ModConfig/deathcorpses.json` on first run. All settings are server-side.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CanFired` | `false` | Whether the corpse can burn in lava/fire (destroyed after ~15 seconds) |
| `HasHealth` | `false` | Whether the corpse has 100 HP and can be broken by other players |
| `CreateCorpse` | `true` | Whether a corpse entity is spawned at all. If false, items are dropped on the ground |
| `SaveInventoryTypes` | hotbar, backpack, crafting, cursor, character | Which inventory slots are saved into the corpse |
| `CommandPrivilege` | `gamemode` | Privilege required to use `/dc` commands |
| `MaxCorpsesSavedPerPlayer` | `10` | How many corpses to keep on disk per player (for `/dc corpse`) |
| `CreateWaypoint` | `Auto` | Whether to create a death waypoint. `Auto` disables it if another mod already handles death waypoints, `Always` forces it, `None` disables it |
| `WaypointIcon` | `bee` | Icon for the death waypoint. Options: `circle`, `bee`, `cave`, `home`, `ladder`, `pick`, `rocks`, `ruins`, `spiral`, `star1`, `star2`, `trader`, `vessel`, etc. |
| `WaypointColor` | `crimson` | Color for the death waypoint. Accepts .NET color names (see [99colors.net](https://www.99colors.net/dot-net-colors)) |
| `PinWaypoint` | `true` | Whether the death waypoint is pinned on the map |
| `DisableVanillaDeathWaypoint` | `true` | Suppresses the vanilla "You died here" tombstone waypoint |
| `RemoveWaypointOnCollect` | `true` | Removes the death waypoint when the corpse is collected |
| `FreeCorpseAfterTime` | `240` | In-game hours after which anyone can collect the corpse. `0` = always free, negative = never free |
| `CorpseCollectionTime` | `1` | Seconds of right-click hold required to collect the corpse |
| `CorpseCompassEnabled` | `true` | Enables the Corpse Compass item. Setting to `false` turns existing compasses into unknown items |
| `ObituariesEnabled` | `false` | Enables the Obituary item purchasable from traders. Setting to `false` removes it from traders and creative inventory |
| `ObituariesHintRadius` | `50` | Radius (in blocks) around the corpse within which the obituary hint position is randomized (1–1000) |
| `ObituariesFavorOnline` | `false` | If true, obituaries prefer binding to corpses belonging to online players. If false, picks equally from all corpses saved on disk |
| `DropArmorOnDeath` | `Vanilla` | Controls armor drop behaviour. `Vanilla` = respect the game's own setting, `Armor` = always save armor into the corpse, `ArmorAndCloth` = save armor and clothing |
| `RemoveCorpseOnGet` | `true` | If true, `/dc corpse get` removes the corpse entity and save file after restoring the inventory |
| `RandomCorpse` | `false` | If true, disables waypoint creation and spawns the corpse at a random location within `RandomCorpseRadius` blocks of the death point |
| `RandomCorpseRadius` | `5000` | Maximum radius (in blocks) from the death point where the corpse can spawn when `RandomCorpse` is enabled (1–10000) |
| `DebugMode` | `false` | Broadcasts internal corpse creation/collection messages to all players |

## Building

This repo uses [Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for fully reproducible builds. No local Vintage Story or .NET installation is required — Nix fetches everything.

### Prerequisites

- Nix with flakes enabled. If you don't have it: [install Nix](https://nixos.org/download) then add `experimental-features = nix-command flakes` to `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`.

### Build the mod zip

```sh
nix build .#zip
```

The zip contains a single `deathcorpses.dll` that embeds two compiled variants:

- `deathcorpses-net8.bin` — impl compiled against VS 1.21.6 (.NET 8)
- `deathcorpses-net10.bin` — impl compiled against VS 1.22 (.NET 10)

At startup the loader checks `Environment.Version.Major` and loads the matching variant from its own manifest resources. This avoids the `MissingFieldException` caused by `Entity.Pos` changing from a field in VS 1.21 to a property in VS 1.22, while keeping a single zip for all supported versions.

The resulting zip is at `./result` and is ready to drop into your `Mods/` folder or upload to the mod portal.

### Updating the (NuGet) Nix package lockfiles

`src/deps/net8.0.json` and `src/deps/net10.0.json` pin the NuGet packages fetched during each impl build. If you add, remove, or version-bump a `<PackageReference>` in the `.csproj`, regenerate both:

```sh
nix build .#fetch-deps-net8  && ./result ./src/deps/net8.0.json
nix build .#fetch-deps-net10 && ./result ./src/deps/net10.0.json
```

---

## Verifying release artifacts

Every release zip is built by CI from a tagged commit using the same Nix flake as this repo. Because Nix locks every dependency by hash, the build is reproducible: building the same tag locally will produce a bit-for-bit identical zip.

To verify that a release artifact matches the source:

**1. Download the release zip from GitHub**

Find the zip attached to a release on the [releases page](https://github.com/Bisa/DeathCorpses/releases) and note its SHA-256 hash:

```sh
sha256sum deathcorpses-<version>.zip
```

**2. Checkout the corresponding tag and build it yourself**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Bisa/DeathCorpses
cd DeathCorpses
git checkout <version>
nix build .#release-zip
sha256sum ./result
```

If both hashes match, the artifact on GitHub is exactly what was built from that commit — nothing was added, removed, or tampered with.

### Verifying prereleases

Prereleases (`-rc.N` versions) patch `src/modinfo.json` before building, so a plain `nix build` won't reproduce them. Use the included script to replicate the CI steps:

```sh
# Verify prerelease 2.6.0-rc.15 built from the main branch
./scripts/verify-build.sh prerelease 15 main
```

### Verifying dev builds

Local dev builds from clean trees (version format `X.Y.Z-dev.N+g<hash>`) are also reproducible:

```sh
# Reproduce a dev build from a specific commit
./scripts/verify-build.sh dev abc1234
```

Dirty tree builds (`dev.0`) are not reproducible since the uncommitted state is unknown.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to submit changes, including DCO sign-off requirements and PR workflow.

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). All commit messages must follow the format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.

Local git hooks validate commit messages and DCO sign-off. They are configured automatically when entering the dev shell:

```sh
nix develop
```

If you don't use `nix develop`, enable them manually: `git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks`

PR commits are also validated in CI (DCO sign-off is enforced for external contributors; the repo owner is exempt).

---

## Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

| Change | Version bump |
|---|---|
| Breaking save/config/API changes | `MAJOR` |
| New features, backwards-compatible | `MINOR` |
| Bug fixes | `PATCH` |

The version in `src/modinfo.json` is the single source of truth. It must be committed before tagging — the release CI enforces this by failing if the tag does not exactly match the version in `src/modinfo.json`.

Local dirty builds automatically append a short commit hash (e.g. `1.0.0+abc1234-dirty`) to distinguish them from clean releases.

---

## Releasing

1. Bump `"version"` in `src/modinfo.json`
2. Commit: `git commit -am "chore: release 1.0.1"`
3. Tag: `git tag 1.0.1`
4. Push: `git push origin main 1.0.1`

CI will build the zip, generate a changelog from conventional commits, and publish it as the GitHub release body. The build will fail if the tag does not match the version in `src/modinfo.json`.

To preview the changelog locally:

```sh
nix develop
./scripts/generate-changelog.sh              # stable
./scripts/generate-changelog.sh --prerelease # prerelease
```

### Release candidates

To publish a prerelease from any branch or commit without a tag, trigger the **Release** workflow manually:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml -f ref=main
```

Or use the GitHub Actions UI. This produces a prerelease tagged `1.0.0-rc.42` (base version from `src/modinfo.json` + CI run number).
